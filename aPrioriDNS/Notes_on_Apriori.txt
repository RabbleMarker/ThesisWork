Command used to hook into conda (execute at every start!)
eval "$(/home/pfisun7n/mansurov/miniforge3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"

Additionally, needed to modify kaggle variable to point to my credentials, for that I ran
conda env config vars set KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/pfisun7n/mansurov



Approach to solving the "running out of memory" problem: Instead of loading everything, use pointers
	+ Huge leap in accessibility! No need for overspecced systems,
	a Uni laptop could already be enough
	- Increases amount of disk read operations
	- might be slower, since you have to look at disk (instead of RAM)
	each time you want to know something


Expansion to handle multiple timeframes/timesteps
	- Looks to be id based, sort timestep by id (id0000, id0001 etc)
	- get actual timestep from setup file (if present, e.g. OpenFOAM)


Download function downloading tutorial case exlusively? 
Would be great to expand it to download BlastNET cases

Handles saving plots with a save=True/False check,
	- would recommend leaving it to the user (returning the plot object, fig/ax?)
	- Should sanitize filenames or just let the user overwrite them e.g. filename=Plot.png. The Linux filesystem LaTeX formatted Units (e.g. $[kg/m^3/s]$) in the filename itself poorly and errors out on my end when trying to save a Plot containing these in its name
	- svg Plot format? Higher resolution plots?



chunk loading parallelization: on by default?

Scatter Plot file outputs named "Contour Plot"?

Interrupt for already created data? Genius!
